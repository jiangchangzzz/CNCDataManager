<p>
If different versions of the MultiBody library are not
compatible to each other, corresponding conversion scripts are
provided. As a result, models build with an older version
of the MultiBody library are automatically converted to the
new version when the model is loaded. The user is prompted
whether automatic conversion shall take place or not.
Problems are not to be expected. Still one should first make
a copy of such a model as backup before the conversion 
is performed.
</p>
<p>
<b><font color="#008000">Upgrade from ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody</font></b>
</p>
<p>
There is now also a conversion script from the "old"
<b>ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody</b> library to the
"new" Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody library. This script is also
automatically invoked. Since the differences between the "old" and the
"new" MultiBody library are so large, not everything is
converted and it might be that some pieces have to
be adapted manually. Still, this script is useful, since
many class names, parameters and modifiers are
automatically converted. 
</p>
<p>
Components from the following sublibraries
are automatically converted
to the Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody library:
</p>
<ul>
<li> ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody.Parts</li>
<li> ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody.Joints</li>
<li> ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody.Forces</li>
<li> Part of ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody.Interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>
Models using the ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody library
that are programmed with <b>equations</b> are only partly converted:
The Frame connectors will be converted to the "new"
Frame connectors of the MultiBody library, but the equations 
that reference variables of the Frame connectors will 
<b>not</b> be converted. For a manual conversion, the following 
table might be helpful showing how the <b>variables</b> of the
"old" and the "new" <b>Frame connectors</b> are 
related to each other (resolve2 and angularVelocity2 are
functions from library Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Frames):

<b><font color="#008000">Upgrade from MultiBody 0.99 (and earlier) to 1.0 (and later)</font></b>
<p>
The conversion from MultiBody 0.99 to 1.0 does not work in some rare
cases, where own components are implemented using functions of the
MultiBody.Frames package. In this case, the conversion has to be
performed manually. The changes in 1.0 with regards to 0.99 are:
</p>
<p>
The definition of the Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Frames.Orientation object has changed.
In 0.99 this was just an alias type for a transformation matrix
(now Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Frames.TransformationMatrices.Orientation).
In 1.0 the orientation object is a record holding the
transformation matrix from frame 1 to frame 2 and the angular 
velocity of the transformation matrix resolved in frame 2.
The reason is that this allows to compute the angular velocity
in many cases by standard recursive formulas and not by
differentiation of the transformation matrix. This is usually
much more efficient. As a consequence, the following
calls in 0.99 should be changed:
</p>
<pre>
   Frames.angularVelocity1(T,der(T)) -> Frames.angularVelocity1(T)
   Frames.angularVelocity2(T,der(T)) -> Frames.angularVelocity2(T)
   Frames.from_T(T)                  -> Frames.from_T2(T,der(T))

<h4>Version 1.1.3, 2005-04-21</h4>
<p>
This version has some minor improvements:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Component MultiBody.<b>Sensors.Distance</b> has been modified: If the distance
     is less than s_small (a parameter in the "advanced" menu), it is approximated
     such that the derivative is finite for zero distance. Previously,
     an assert was triggered.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 1.1.2, 2005-04-06</h4>
<p>
This version has some minor improvements:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Component MultiBody.<b>World</b> has a new parameter
     <b>driveTrainMechanics3D</b>. If set to <b>true</b>, 3-dim. mechanical effects
     of MultiBody.Parts.Mounting1D/Rotor1D/BevelGear1D are taken into account. If set to 
     <b>false</b> (= default), 3-dim. mechanical effects in these elements
     are not taken into account and the
     frame connectors to connect to 3-dim. parts are disabled (all
     connections to such a disabled connector are also disabled, due to the
     new feature of conditional declarations in Modelica language 2.2).
     </li>
<li> All references to "MultiBody.xxx" have
     been changed to "Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.xxx" in order that after
     copying of a component outside of the Modelica library, the references
     still remain valid.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 1.1.1, 2004-11-03</h4>
<p>
This version has some minor improvements:
</p>
<ul>
<li> New function MultiBody.<b>Frames.from_T2</b> to compute an orientation
     object from a transformation matrix and its derivative.</li>
<li> Added a paragraph in the "Upgrade from Former Versions" section
     of the User's Guide to show how a conversion from 0.99 to 1.0 that
     may fail in rare cases should be fixed manually.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 1.1, 2004-07-07</h4>
<p>
Included the MultiBody library as Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody 
in version 2.0 Beta 1 of the Modelica package, 
and adapted all signal connectors
to the new definition of Modelica.Blocks.Interfaces.
</p>
<h4>Version 1.0.1, 2004-07-07</h4>
<p>
This version fixes only some minor bugs:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Bug in Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Sensors.<b>RelativeSensor</b> fixed:<br>
     When frame resolve was connected and get_v_rel=true or
     get_a_rel=true, an error was in the code</li>.
<li> Bug in MultiBodys.Sensors.<b>Power</b> fixed:<br>
     A "defineBranch(...)" statement was missing. In certain cases, 
     it was then not possible to generate code</li>.
<li> Wrong icon of MultiBody and of Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Interfaces package
     corrected.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 1.0, 2004-03-03</h4>
<p>
This version is <b>not</b> backward compatible to version 0.99.
Models generated with previous MultiBody versions are automatically 
converted to the new release.The incompatible changes are due
to improving the efficiency of the library. This required
to change function interfaces in Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Frames: angularVelocity1,
angularVelocity2, planarRotation, axisRotation, axesRotations, from_T,
from_T_inv, from_Q. Furthermore, Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Frames.Orientation has changed.
As a consequence, all code that accesses objects of this type
directly is no longer valid. Otherwise, the following changes have been made:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Faster code</b>:<br>
     Due to a different strategy to handle orientation objects,
     the number of arithmetic expressions in the generated code is
     reduced (for larger models there is a speed-up of about 2-3).</li>
<li> Improved <b>documentation</b>:<br>
     Tutorial renamed to "User's Guide" and documents restructured
     and improved. Included 3-dimensional images for nearly every
     component description where it makes sense. Improved the
     documentation of the packages.</li>
<li> New package Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Frames.<b>TransformationMatrices</b>:<br>
     This is a copy of the previous Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Frames.XX functions.
     The new Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Frames.XX functions have a different orientation
     object that can no longer be directly used, since the angular
     velocity calculation is implicitly included in the functions
     to improve efficiency significantly</li>
<li> New function Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Frames.<b>resolveRelative</b>:<br>
     Transform vector from frame 1 to frame 2 using absolute 
     orientation objects of frame 1 and of frame 2.</li>
<li> Improved handling of orientation in Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Joints.<b>Spherical</b>,
     Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Joints.<b>FreeMotion</b>, Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Parts.<b>Body</b>:<br>
     If states are used from these components, the orientation is either 
     described by quaternions or by 3 angles along desired sequence
     axes. If 3 angles are used, the code is such that symbolic
     transformation methods for inline integration can generate efficient
     code. In "Spherical" and "Body" the switching between different
     sets of 3 angles has been removed since this may lead to difficulties
     for the symbolic transformations. In "FreeMotion" the option to
     use quaternions has been added.</li>
<li> New option for "MultiBody.Sensors.<b>AbsoluteSensor</b>":<br>
     Optionally, the angles to rotate the world frame into frame_a
     are returned.</li>
<li> New option for "MultiBody.Sensors.<b>RelativeSensor</b>":<br>
     Optionally, the angles to rotate frame_a into frame_b
     are returned.</li>
<li> Improved "MultiBody.Examples.Loops.<b>EngineV6_analytic</b>":<br>
     Model restructured and animated with CAD data.</li>
<li> <b>Specular coefficient</b> introduced with default 0.7:<br>
     The components in Visualizers.Advanced have as additional
     input the specular coefficient describing the reflection
     of ambient light. The default is 0.7. Coordinate systems
     have a specular coefficient of 0 (= light is not reflected).
     </li>
<li> Improved Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Frames.<b>Frame_resolve</b>:<br>
     The frame outline is with a full line. When drawing a
     connection line from Frame_resolve to another frame,
     this connection line is dotted.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 0.99, 2004-02-16</h4>
<p>
This version is <b>fully</b> backward compatible to version 0.98.
The following changes have been made:
</p>
 
<ul>
<li> New options for "MultiBody.Joints.<b>Spherical</b>".<br>
     This joint may have optionally Cardan angles or quaternions
     as states. Additionally, an "Initialization" tab has been
     added in order that the relative coordinates of the joint
     can be used for initialization.</li>
<li> New model "MultiBody.Joints.<b>GearConstraint</b>"<br>
     to model the 3-dim. constraint of a gear box.</li>
<li> New model "MultiBody.Parts.<b>Mounting1D</b>" <br>
     to propagate 1-dim. support torques to a 3-dim. mounting.</li>
<li> New model "MultiBody.Parts.<b>Rotor1D</b>" <br>
     to attach a 1-dim. inertia on 3-dim. mountings without 
     neglecting dynamic effects.</li>
<li> New model "MultiBody.Parts.<b>BevelGear1D</b>" <br>
     that describes a 1-dim. gearbox with arbitrary shaft
     directions and that is attached on a 3-dim. mounting.</li>
<li> New package "MultiBody.Examples.Systems.<b>RobotR3</b>".<br>
     The models of this package are used to demonstrate in which
     way complex robot models might be built up by testing first
     the component models individually before composing them together. 
     Furthermore, it is shown how CAD data can be used for animation.
<li> New model "MultiBody.Sensors.<b>AbsoluteSensor</b>"<br>
     to provide kinematic quantities of a frame as output signals
     resolved in the local frame, in the world frame or in a frame that
     is connected to the AbsoluteSensor object via connector frame_resolve.</li>
<li> New model "MultiBody.<b>Sensors.Distance</b>"<br>
     to provide the distance between frame_a and frame_b as output signal.
     Derivatives of the distance can be easily obtained by connecting
     block Modelica.Blocks.Continuous.Der to the outPort.</li>
<li> New models "MultiBody.<b>Sensors.Force/.Torque/.ForceAndTorque</b>"<br>
     to provide cut forces and cut torques between two frames
     as output signals resolved in the local frame, in the world frame  
     or in a frame that is connected to the objects
     via connector frame_resolve.</li>
<li> Improved model "MultiBody.<b>Sensors.RelativeSensor</b>"<br>
     A "frame_resolve" connector has been added, in order that the
     measured kinematic quantities can be resolved in the frame
     that is connected to frame_resolve.</li>
<li> New connector "MultiBody.Interfaces.<b>Frame_resolve</b>"<br>
     that should be used, if a frame provides solely orientation
     information.
     This connector is identical to the connectors "Frame", Frame_a" and
     "Frame_b". Only the icon is different: The border line is dotted
     with default line width and not with double default line width as
     for the other frames. When drawing a connection, the connection
     line is usually by default using the line style of the connector.
     As a result, the connection line will be a thin, dotted line.
     Frame_resolve is now used in all components where the orientation
     of another frame is needed (e.g., in Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Forces.Force to
     define in which frame the force is provided).</li>
<li> New function "MultiBody.Frames.<b>AngularVelocity1</b>"<br>
     to compute the angular velocity of frame 2 with respect to frame 1
     resolved in frame 1 (previously, only function AngularVelocity2 
     was provided to resolve the angular velocity in frame 2. Transforming
     this vector in to frame 1 is less efficient as directly computing
     the angular velocity resolved in frame 1).</li>
<li> New conversion script "MultiBody\Scripts\<b>ConvertOldToNewMultiBody.mos</b>"<br>
     to convert models from the "old" ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody
     library to the "new" MultiBody" library. For details, see
     <A HREF="Modelica_Mechanics_MultiBody_UsersGuide.html#Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.UsersGuide.Upgrade"
>
      Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.UsersGuide.Upgrade</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 0.98, 2003-10-27</h4>
<p>
This version is <b>not backward</b> compatible to the previous
MultiBody versions, since the initialization has changed.
Parameter "startValuesFixed" is no longer present and is
replaced by parameter "initType" (see below). Models generated with 
previous MultiBody versions are automatically converted to the new
release.
</p>
 
<ul>
<li> <b>Tutorial</b> improved.</li>

     Spherical - spherical - prismatic joint aggregation with mass 
     (no constraints, no potential states) for analytic loop handling.</li>
<li> New model "MultiBody.Forces.<b>LineForceWithTwoMasses</b>"<br>
     General line force component with two optional point masses on 
     the connection line.</li>

     Determine spring constant such that system is in steady 
     state at given position.</li>
<li> Removed model "MultiBody.Examples.ForceWithMass"<br>
     This demo is included in the new LineForceWithTwoMasses
     example.</li>
<li> Change in "MultiBody.Parts.<b>Body</b>"<br>
     The default of parameter "useQuaternions" in the
     "Advanced" menu is changed from false to true.
     This means that by default quaternions are used as
     body states.</li>
<li> Change in all models that have potential states:<br>
     <b>New initialization</b> introduced replacing the previous
     "startValuesFixed" parameter. The new parameter "initType"
     can have the following values:
<pre>
 initType = Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Types.Init
  .Free                        : no initialization
                                 (= same as previous startValuesFixed = <b>false</b>)
  .PositionVelocity            : initialize generalized position and velocity variables
                                 (= same as previous startValuesFixed = <b>true</b>)
  .SteadyState                 : initialize in steady state 
                                 (velocity and acceleration are zero)
  .Position                    : initialize only generalized position variable(s)
  .Velocity                    : initialize only generalized velocity variable(s)
  .VelocityAcceleration        : initialize generalized velocity and 
                                 acceleration variables
  .PositionVelocityAcceleration: initialize generalized position, velocity 
                                 and acceleration variables
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 0.97, 2003-09-10</h4>
<p>
Bug fixed in model "MultiBody.Parts.Body": There was an
error when switching 
from one set of Cardan angles to another one when the actual
Cardan angles are close to their singularity.
This has been corrected.
</p>
<h4>Version 0.96, 2003-08-04</h4>
<p>
This was the first version delivered with Dymola.

<li> The central idea to handle a certain class of overdetermined, consistent
     set of differential algebraic equations (i.e., there are more equations than
     unknowns) with symbolic transformation algorithms was developed together
     with Hilding Elmqvist and Sven Erik Mattsson from Dynasim AB, Lund, Sweden.
     The MultiBody library is heavily relying on this feature which is a
     prerequiste for a truely "object-oriented" multi-body systems library,
     where components can be connected together in any meaningful way.<li>
<li> The Examples.Loops.EngineV6 demo of a six cylinder V6 engine with
     6 planar loops and 1 degree of freedom is from Hilding Elmqvist and
     Sven Erik Mattsson.</li>
<li> Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Forces.LineForceWithMass is based on model
     "RelativeDistance" from the Modelica VehicleDynamics library of
     Johan Andreasson from Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.</li>
<li> The 1-dim. components (Parts.Rotor1D, Parts.BevelGear1D, Mounting1D) and
     Joints.GearConstraints are from Christian Schweiger.</li>
<li> The design of this library is based on work carried out
     in the EU RealSim project (Real-time Simulation for Design of
     Multi-physics Systems) funded by the European Commission within 
     the Information Societies Technology (IST) programme under 
     contract number IST 1999-11979.
